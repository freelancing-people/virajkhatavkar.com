  I had an use-case to get the contents of a file at a specific commit. I knew that git had the
  necessary data but was unsure regarding how to get it. After searching on google a bit, I found the
  solution and thought to document it here in the blog so we all can refer this whenever needed.

We all know that git stores repository related data as objects in the .git folder. Recently, while implementing Ftp / S3 deployments for [Deploy-Tantra](https://deploytantra.com), I had an use-case to get the contents of a file at a specific commit. I knew that git had the necessary data but was unsure regarding how to get it. After searching on google a bit, I found the solution and thought to document it here in the blog so we all can refer this whenever needed.

~~~.language-git

git show {commit}:{file}
~~~

The above command will output the contents of file recorded by git at the specified commit.

Another use-case with a little change in syntax : if you want to see the contents of a file 5 commits back, you can use following command:

~~~.language-git

git show HEAD~5:{file}
~~~
