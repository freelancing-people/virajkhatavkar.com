With the release of CakePHP 3.5, there are tons of features available. I'll be covering all of them one by one. Let's get started with the environment variables.

At the moment you don't track the <code class="language-markdown">app.php</code> or other similar configuration files in your repository. The configuration options for your app mostly reside in this file. You have to share this file with your peers or keep a local copy and update it whenever you do a small change in configuration. Until now there wasn't a decent way to have environment variables in CakePHP. In 3.5, a support for dotenv was added which opened avenues for adding environment variables.


### Using Environment Variables

If you install a brand new CakePHP application, you will see a <code class="language-markdown">.env.default</code> file which contains some dummy credentials.

Now, make a copy of the file and rename it to <code class="language-markdown">.env</code>. If you see the file contents, you will find that the environment variables are exported with their values. These environment variables will be available to your application configuration.

Let us see a quick example of how you can use these environment variables to populate your DB credentials in your <code class="language-markdown">app.php</code> configuration file.

Let us first add the environment variables in our <code class="language-markdown">.env</code>:

~~~.language-php

export DB_USERNAME="root"
export DB_PASSWORD="secret"
export DB_HOST="localhost"
export DB_DATABASE="cakephp"
~~~

Now modify your <code class="language-markdown">app.php</code> to fetch the DB credentials from your environment variables:

~~~.language-php

'Datasources' => [
    'default' => [
        ...,
        ...,
        'host' => env('DB_HOST'),
        'username' => env('DB_USERNAME'),
        'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD'),
        'database' => env('DB_DATABASE'),
        'encoding' => 'utf8',
        ...,
        ...,
    ],
~~~

And now you're done. You can have all your API credentials, cache configurations or any other configuration which is secret or different for production in these environment variables. Get away with the hassle of sharing configuration files.

I was waiting for this, and this makes my life a lot easier now. It's simple, easy to maintain and hassle-free from a developer standpoint of view.
