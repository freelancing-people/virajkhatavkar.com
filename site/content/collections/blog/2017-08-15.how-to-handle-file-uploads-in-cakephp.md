  Over the last several years we have used the move_uploaded_file() function. With the new PSR-7

If you have had to use the <code class="language-markdown">move_uploaded_file</code> method for uploading files, you know how terrible experience it can be. CakePHP doesn't have an in-built library or helper to handle file uploads. We have to use the <code class="language-markdown">move_uploaded_file</code> method, and it simply is not the most convenient way to upload files:

~~~.language-php

$uploads_dir = '/uploads';

foreach ($_FILES["pictures"]["error"] as $key => $error) {
    if ($error == UPLOAD_ERR_OK) {
        $tmp_name = $_FILES["pictures"]["tmp_name"][$key];
        $name = basename($_FILES["pictures"]["name"][$key]);
        move_uploaded_file($tmp_name, "$uploads_dir/$name");
    }
}
~~~

### Problem 1: It doesn't behave as expected in case we are uploading an array of files.

Suppose your form has a multi-file upload:

~~~.language-html

<input type="file" multiple>
~~~

then your form is submitting an array of files, but the <code class="language-markdown">$_FILES</code> superglobal will represent it as:

~~~.language-php

[
    'files' => [
        'name' => [
            0 => 'photo1.jpg',
            1 => 'photo2.jpg',
        ],
        'type' => [
            0 => 'image/jpeg',
            1 => 'image/jpeg',
        ],
    ],
]
~~~

instead of the following:

~~~.language-php

[
    'files' => [
        0 => [
            'name' => 'photo1.jpg',
            'type' => 'image/jpeg',
        ],
        1 => [
            'name' => 'photo.jpg',
            'type' => 'image/jpeg',
            /* etc. */
        ],
    ],
]
~~~

Due to the above implementation, we have to write separate logic for transforming the array. It simply leaks unnecessary language implementation detail in our controllers, and I'm not a big fan of that.

### Other Problems: 

1. The <code class="language-markdown">$_FILES</code> array is not populated if the request is not <code class="language-markdown">post</code>

2. It is not possible to have the <code class="language-markdown">$_FILES</code> array populated when we are writing tests.

3.  Using <code class="language-markdown">move_uploaded_file</code> doesn't feel like we are writing clean code.

### PSR-7 Compliant request

In some version between **3.3** and **3.4** CakePHP introduced PSR-7 compliant HTTP stack. The request interface in PSR-7 has a <code class="language-markdown">getUploadedFiles</code> method. As CakePHP implements this interface, it needs to have an implementation of the <code class="language-markdown">getUploadedFiles</code> method.

Now, we can access all the uploaded files in a controller:

~~~.language-php

public function add()
{
    $files = $this->request->getUploadedFiles();
}
~~~

To get a specific file:

~~~.language-php

public function add()
{
    $files = $this->request->getUploadedFile('avatar')
}
~~~

The <code class="language-markdown">getUploadedFiles</code> and <code class="language-markdown">getUploadedFile</code> method returns an instance of [<code class="language-markdown">Zend\Diactoros\UploadedFile</code>](https://zendframework.github.io/zend-diactoros/api/#uploadedfile) which implements the official [<code class="language-markdown">Psr\Http\Message\UploadedFileInterface</code>](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/#36-psrhttpmessageuploadedfileinterface). We have few other methods listed in the interface which helps us to upload files quickly.

### Storing the uploaded files

To store the uploaded files, you can use the <code class="language-markdown">moveTo</code> method on the retrieved file instance:

~~~.language-php

$file = $this->request->getUploadedFile('avatar');

$file->moveTo('avatars/' . $file->getClientFilename());
~~~

If you want to rename the file before storing:

~~~.language-php

$filename = sprintf('%s.%s', 'your-file-name', pathinfo($file->getClientFilename(), PATHINFO_EXTENSION));

$file->moveTo("avatars/$filename");
~~~

As you can see, we now have a simpler, more convenient, more graceful, and more compact way to handle file uploads.

**Problem**: Using the <code class="language-markdown">getClientFilename</code> method for retrieving the file extension is not safe. Users may try to send across a malicious file which can corrupt your system. There isn't any easy way around this, but you would need to guess the file extension depending upon the contents of the uploaded file.

**Solution**: Symfony has HTTPFoundation component, which does the job for us more securely and conveniently.

### Using the HTTPFoundation Component

We can use the Symfony's [HTTPFoundation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation.html) component to handle our file uploads more subtly. I use it because it provides much more fluent and secure API to handle file uploads.

First, install the HTTPFoundation component using Composer:

~~~.language-bash

composer require symfony/http-foundation
~~~

Now, to retrieve the uploaded file:

~~~.language-php

use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

public function add()
{
    $request = Request::createFromGlobals();
    
    $file = $request->files->get('avatar');
}
~~~

To check if the uploaded file is a valid file:

~~~.language-php

if($file->isValid()) {
	// Upload file
}
~~~

To store the uploaded file:

~~~.language-php

if($file->isValid()) {
    $filename = sprintf('%s.%s', 'your-file-name', $file->guessExtension());
    $file->move('avatars-updated', $filename);
}
~~~

As I have said earlier, you need to guess the file extension depending on the contents of the file. The <code class="language-markdown">guessExtension</code> method does the same thing for us.

There are much more methods available in the API which you can use to interact with the uploaded file. The official [API documentation](http://api.symfony.com/3.0/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/File/UploadedFile.html#method_guessExtension) of Symfony specifies the use-case for each of them.

### Conclude

That's it! It's pretty straightforward and easy to implement, but I think it makes the entire workflow of handling file uploads a lot cleaner and more predictable. I love it.
