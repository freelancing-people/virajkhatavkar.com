A little while ago, I was attempting to write better integration tests. CakePHP doesn't have inbuilt support for writing expressive tests in the same way as a real user might interact with the system. Doing a bit of research over what packages I could use for writing better integration tests, Codeception turned out to be the best option for me. I was able to configure Codeception along with Selenium server, but I wasn't satisfied. The overall time it took for running my 16 browser simulated tests was about 4-5 minutes, which is huge if you are following TDD workflow. You can run those tests using PHPBrowser instead of Selenium, which still is comparatively slower and uses curl for simulating requests. Using curl would create another problem because it would try to connect the default database rather than the test database as it will trigger a real request to your application's url. 

This overall workflow doesn't seem to be integrated well enough to leverage any configurations specific to my test environment. I decided to use Codeception along-with selenium server only for JavaScript based use-cases, such as testing modal forms or triggering AJAX calls on click of a button, etc.

Long story short, for non-JavaScript workflows, I wanted to have a simple setup which would leverage the API present in the <code class="language-markdown">IntegrationTestCase.php</code>. I didn't find anything close to this, so I decided to write a package for achieving this.

### Introducing CakePHP-Integrated

<a href="https://github.com/viraj-khatavkar/cakephp-integrated" target="_blank">You can download the package here.</a>

Using the Integrated package, you can write integration tests in an expressive syntax. You can check whether the text **Register Here** is present on the home page, by a simple test:

~~~.language-php

$this->openPage('/')
     ->seeText('Register Here');
~~~

### Filling Forms

This package makes it easy to fill forms. If you have a form:

~~~.language-html

<form method="post" action="/posts/add">

	<fieldset>

		<legend>Add Post</legend>
        
        <div class="input text required">
			<label for="title">Title</label>
			<input type="text" name="title" id="title">
        </div>
        
        <div class="input text required">
        	<label for="author">Author</label>
        	<input type="text" name="author" id="author">
        </div>
        
        <div class="input textarea required">
	        <label for="body">Body</label>
    	    <textarea name="body" id="body" rows="5"></textarea>
        </div>

        <div class="select required">
	        <label for="gender">Gender</label>
            <select name="gender" id="gender">
	            <option value="female">Female</option>
    	        <option value="male">Male</option>
        	    <option value="other">Other</option>
            </select>
        </div>


        <div class="input checkbox">
            <label for="published">
            <input type="checkbox" name="published" value="1" id="published">Published
            </label>
		</div>    
        
	</fieldset>

	<button type="submit">Submit</button>    

</form>
~~~

Then an integration test for testing the above form would be like this:

~~~.language-php

$this->openPage('/posts/add')
	 ->fillInField('title', 'My identity')
     ->fillInField('author', 'Arya Stark')
     ->fillInField('body', 'I am no one')
     ->select('gender', 'female')
     ->check('published')
     ->press('Submit')
     ->canSeePageIs('/posts')
     ->seeText('My identity');
~~~

### Testing selects with multiple options

If your form allows to select multiple options:

~~~.language-html

<select name="hobbies[]" multiple>
	<option value="impersonating">Impersonating Lord Frey</option>
	<option value="murder">Murder Littlefinger</option>
	<option value="swordfighting">Swordfighting</option>
</select>
~~~

Then your test would be:

~~~.language-php

...
$this->select('hobbies', ['impersonating', 'murder']);
...
...
...
~~~

### Clicking Links

If you have a page containing a link:

~~~.language-html

<a href="/posts/add">Add a Post</a>
~~~

...you can test whether clicking a link can redirect you to a specific page:

~~~.language-php

$this->openPage('/posts')
	 ->click('Add a Post')
	 ->canSeePageIs('/posts/add')
	 ->seeText('New Post');
~~~

### Using DatabaseMigrations Trait

CakePHP has inbuilt support for fixtures. To use them in your test classes, you have to define them, and then, import the dependent fixtures in your test class. When you have a pretty large database, there are too many table dependencies even for a single test. I prefer to have my whole schema migrated during tests, but I don't want to go through the entire process of defining fixtures for every table. Having an entire schema migrated for tests makes me feel confident that my system is as close to my production environment as possible.

To have your whole schema migrated and dropped before each test you can use the <code class="language-markdown">DatabaseMigrations</code> trait in your test classes:

~~~.language-php

use TestDummy\Traits\DatabaseMigrations;

class AddPostTest extends CakeTestCase
{
    use DatabaseMigrations;
}
~~~

...the trait will take care of migrating all migrations before each test, and drop all tables after every test.

### Using Factories

The Integrated package also provides a simple way to generate random fake data for your tests. Again, hard coding fake data in fixtures does not solve all of my use-cases. During specific conditions, I want to insert particular data, and for other tests, any random data would do. Factories help you do this in a very compact way:

**Step 1:** Create a factories file

Within the <code class="language-markdown">config/Factories</code> directory, create a <code class="language-markdown">TableFactory.php</code> file with the following contents:

~~~.language-php

<?php

$factory = \TestDummy\Definition::getInstance();
~~~

Within a <code class="language-markdown">config/Factories</code> directory, you may create any number of PHP files that will automatically be loaded by our package.

**Step 2:** Define a factory

Before using factories, you must define them in the above file. An example factory definition would look like this:

~~~.language-php

<?php

$factory = \TestDummy\Definition::getInstance();

$factory->define('Posts', function (Faker\Generator $faker) {
    return [
        'title'     => $faker->sentence,
        'author'    => $faker->name,
        'body'      => $faker->paragraph,
        'published' => true,
    ];
});
~~~

In <code class="language-markdown">TableFactory.php</code> you will have access to <code class="language-markdown">$faker</code> variable which is an instance of the <code class="language-markdown">Generator</code> class in the Faker package. Using Faker, you can create random data of various types and even get values which are local to your country. Please [read the documentation](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) of Faker to understand their API.

**Step 3:** Using factories

Now, you can use your defined factories in the tests:

~~~.language-php

/** @test */
public function user_can_edit_a_post()
{
    $post = factory('Posts')->create();

    $this->post('/posts/edit/' . $post->id, [
         ...
		'title'     => 'Updated Post',
         ...
         ...
    ]);
        
    //Your assertions

}
~~~


### Impersonating Users

If you have a form which can be accessed only by an authenticated user you can test it easily:

~~~.language-php

$user = factory('Users')->create();

$this->actingAs($user)
	 ->openPage('/posts/add')
     ->fillInField('title', 'My first post')
     ...
     ...
     ...
~~~
